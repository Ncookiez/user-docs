# About PoolTogether

PoolTogether is a [prize savings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked\_savings\_account) protocol, enabling you to win by saving.&#x20;

1. Deposit USDC for a chance to win
2. Participate in daily prize draws
3. Withdraw your deposit any time - even if you don't win!

Every dollar you deposit gives you a chance to win prizes. The more you save, the higher your odds!

PoolTogether is one of the first and most widely used DeFi (_Decentralized Finance_) applications and has been **live for over three years.** Since its inception, the protocol distributed over $5 million in prizes to depositors. [The luckiest winner so far deposited $74 and won over $40,000](https://decrypt.co/66354/crypto-no-loss-lottery-winner-turns-74-into-40000).

### How does it work?

This is possible because prizes are made up of the interest that accrues on all deposited funds:

üè¶ Users deposit into the network

üìà Yield accrues on all deposits

üèÜ The yield is randomly awarded as prizes to the users.
