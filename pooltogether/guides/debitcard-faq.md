<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/gateway.ipfscdn.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### What is the PoolTogether Card?

The PoolTogether Card is a Debit Card powered by Juno. It allows you to spend your PoolTogether balance on everyday things.

### How does it work?

There are two ways to use the PoolTogether Debit Card. You can choose to use either a Push or the Pull Method.

<details>

<summary>Top-Up (Push Method)</summary>

Whenever a user tops up their card, their USDC is liquidated to USD and deposited into an FDIC-insured checking account to ensure the safety of their funds.&#x20;

Example: A user will convert PTaUSDC to USDC (say $500 at a time) and then spend that USDC when they make purchases.&#x20;

On a technical level:

* User cashes out their crypto from their Web3 Wallet to a FDIC-insured Checking Account
*   The Debit Card (MasterCard) that is linked to the Checking Account is used for spending on everyday items.&#x20;



</details>

<details>

<summary>Direct Spending (Pull Method)</summary>

With direct spending, PTaUSDC is withdrawn (pulled) from the Web3 wallet directly at point of sale.

On a technical level:

* User approves their PTaUSDC to be spent by the contract.&#x20;
* The withdrawFromPool() function is called, and it withdraws from the pool:&#x20;
  * Function burns PTaUSDC and withdraws USDC to the user's wallet.&#x20;
* User approves their USDC to be spent by the contract.&#x20;
* The function performTradeForSpecificAmount() is called, which deposits the USDC into the contract.&#x20;
* The USDC is auto-converted into the checking account
