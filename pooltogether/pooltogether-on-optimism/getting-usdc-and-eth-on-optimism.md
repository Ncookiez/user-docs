### Fiat On-Ramps

A Fiat On-Ramp is a service that allows exchanging fiat currencies (e.g., US dollars, Euros, etc.) for cryptocurrencies. Depending on your country of residence, they offer to purchase crypto directly from your bank account or credit card. Some on-ramps that offer USDC and ETH on Optimism are: &#x20;

### Centralized Exchanges&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Centralized Exchanges typically charge higher fees than Decentralized Exchanges but are easier to use for beginners.

If you don't own any cryptocurrency yet, you can use a Centralized Exchange to purchase ETH or USDC. Centralized Exchanges are custodial trading platforms that match buyers and sellers via an order book.&#x20;

[Layerswap](https://www.layerswap.io/) is a service that allows withdrawing from various CEXes to Optimism L2.
