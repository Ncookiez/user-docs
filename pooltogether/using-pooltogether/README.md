# PoolTogether on Polygon

To use PoolTogether on Polygon, you need the USDC token on the Polygon network and MATIC to cover the transaction fees. Are you still missing any of that? Have a look at [Getting Started](../../welcome/getting-started.md)!

### How to Deposit

Head to the Deposit tab in the PoolTogether App or [follow this link](https://app.pooltogether.com/deposit?network=polygon). Click on "Deposit to win" and choose the Optimism prize pool.

<details>

<summary>Step 1: Check the network &#x26; enter your deposit amount</summary>

First, make sure your wallet is on the Polygon network. Enter the amount of USDC you want to deposit and click on **Review deposit**.

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
The estimated average APR is a rough estimate based on the current TVL and daily prizes. [More information.](../../welcome/faq.md#what-is-the-prize-apr)
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Step 2 - Approve Tokens for deposit</summary>

To deposit into the Prize Pool, you need to allow the PoolTogether protocol to access the USDC tokens in your wallet. This happens through an approval transaction to the PoolTogether Prize Pool contracts.

Click on **Confirm approval** in the PoolTogether App and **confirm** the transaction in your wallet.

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
The token approval does not make a deposit yet; it simply enables the protocol to use the tokens in your wallet. This is a one-time approval process per network.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Step 3 - Deposit Your Tokens</summary>

The "Deposit Confirmation" screen will automatically load after the approval transaction is completed. Click on **Confirm deposit** and **confirm** the deposit transaction in your wallet.&#x20;

After the transaction has been submitted, you will be forwarded to the "Deposit submitted" screen. You are now eligible for all future draws.&#x20;

To reflect your PoolTogether deposit, you will receive the [PTaUSDC](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x6a304dFdb9f808741244b6bfEe65ca7B3b3A6076) ticket token. You can add it to your wallet with the information below:

</details>

| Ticker  | Contract Address                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| PTaUSDC | `0x6a304dFdb9f808741244b6bfEe65ca7B3b3A6076` |

### Checking for Prizes

{% hint style="info" %}
Prizes must be claimed within 60 days of them being awarded. Unclaimed prizes will no longer be claimable after 60 days.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Now that you have a PoolTogether deposit, you can check what prizes you won on the [Prizes](https://app.pooltogether.com/prizes) tab of the PoolTogether App.&#x20;

You have up to 60 days to claim a prize whenever you win. Claiming a prize will cost a transaction fee. Multiple prizes can be claimed at once.&#x20;

Follow [this link](../../welcome/faq.md#prizes-and-winning) for information about prizes and winning.

### How to Withdraw

You can withdraw your deposit from PoolTogether in the [Account](https://app.pooltogether.com/account) tab of the PoolTogether App at any time.

To withdraw, choose a deposit and click on **Withdraw**. Next, enter the amount you want to withdraw and click **Review withdrawal**. On the next screen, hit **Confirm withdrawal** and **confirm** the transaction in your wallet.
