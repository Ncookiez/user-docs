# Getting USDC on Polygon

PoolTogether uses USDC as its deposit token. Here are a few different ways to get USDC on Polygon:

### Decentralized Exchanges

If you already have cryptocurrency in your Polygon wallet, you can easily swap any other token for USDC on a Decentralized Exchange. Here is a list of options:

* [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=polygon)&#x20;
* [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/trident/swap?tokens=MATIC\&tokens=0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174\&chainId=137)&#x20;

### Fiat On-Ramps

A Fiat On-Ramp is a service that allows exchanging fiat currencies (e.g., US dollars, Euros, etc.) for cryptocurrencies. Depending on your country of residence, they offer to purchase crypto directly from your bank account or credit card. Some on-ramps that offer USDC on Polygon are: &#x20;

* [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy)
* [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy/?defaultAsset=USDC)

If you don't own any cryptocurrency yet, you can use a Centralized Exchange to purchase USDC. Centralized Exchanges are custodial trading platforms that match buyers and sellers via an order book.&#x20;

The following Exchanges allow direct USDC withdrawals to the Polygon network:
