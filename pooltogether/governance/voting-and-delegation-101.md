# Voting & Delegation 101

## What can I do with POOL?

The POOL token governs the PoolTogether protocol. POOL token holders can:

1. [Vote on proposals](voting-and-delegation-101.md#voting)
2. [Delegate their voting power](voting-and-delegation-101.md#delegation)
3. [Create governance proposals](voting-and-delegation-101.md#proposals)

### What’s right for me?

Active governance participation might not be for everyone. It includes doing research, providing helpful feedback, coordinating with other delegates, and a certain time commitment to make educated decisions. On the other hand, you get to play an active role in growing the PoolTogether protocol.

Anyone can participate in decentralized governance. If you have questions or need help please don’t hesitate to [ask the community on Discord](https://pooltogether.com/discord).

## Voting

PoolTogether governance exists on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone, either holding POOL or being delegated POOL on Ethereum, can vote.

{% hint style="info" %}
Voting power is determined based on the number of tokens delegated to each address. This means users _must_ submit a delegation transaction before their tokens will be included in governance votes. Users may either delegate to a third party, or self-delegate if they would like to participate in voting directly.
{% endhint %}

### How do I vote?

Voting happens onchain. To cast your vote you can use the [PoolTogether interface](https://vote.pooltogether.com/) or any other alternative governance interface. The outcome is the same, the only difference is the interface.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Onchain voting requires Ethereum transaction fees.
{% endhint %}

### What about POOL on other networks?

POOL tokens on the Optimism or Polygon are only eligible to vote in off-chain governance. This includes decisions that don’t require moving treasury funds or upgrading the protocol.&#x20;

All off-chain voting happens on the PoolTogether.eth Snapshot: [https://snapshot.org/#/pooltogether.eth/](https://snapshot.org/#/pooltogether.eth/)

### How do I know when new proposals are up?

All active proposals are

* previously discussed on the [PoolTogether governance forum](https://gov.pooltogether.com)
* announced on [Discord](https://pooltogether.com/discord)
* displayed in the [PoolTogether app](https://app.pooltogether.com)

## Delegation

You can delegate the voting weight of your POOL tokens to someone else to make governance decisions on your behalf. You still retain full ownership of your tokens, but your delegate will be able to vote.

### What are governance delegates?

Delegates are community members who volunteer to play an active role in PoolTogether protocol governance. _Everyone_ can volunteer to be a governance delegate. Nonetheless, you don’t have to be a governance delegate to be able to vote on proposals.

You can see all Delegate Proposals [in this thread](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/delegate-proposals-mega-thread/2337). Please feel encouraged to post your own.

### How do I delegate?

You can delegate the voting weight of your POOL tokens via [Sybil](https://sybil.org/#/delegates/pool) or [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xB3a87172F555ae2a2AB79Be60B336D2F7D0187f0) (both tools have the same outcome).

If you don’t want to delegate your POOL tokens anymore, you can take your delegation back anytime by delegating to yourself.

## Proposals

### Who can create proposals?

Creating a proposal requires 10,000 POOL (0.1% of the total supply). Anyone who either

* holds 10,000 POOL tokens
* has 10,000 POOL tokens delegated to them
* _**or,**_ has 10,000 POOL combined from both

can submit a governance proposal.

All proposals must be submitted on the governance forum following the proposal process and must be clear, concise, and unambiguous. Organizing the proposals in this way makes it easy to track and discuss changes to PoolTogether.

### **When does a proposal pass?**

Once submitted, governance proposals are voted on for five days. A proposal will pass if, after five days

* the majority of votes are in favor
* **AND** at least 100,000 votes have been cast in favor

There is a two day timelock before the proposal is actually implemented.
