# Governance

### PoolTogether Governance

POOL is the governance token of the PoolTogether protocol. Every POOL token represents a vote in protocol governance.

The primary duty of POOL holder governance is to ensure the growth of the protocol by managing the protocol parameters properly. This includes:

* Protocol parameters like frequency of prizes
* Distributions from the [protocol treasury](https://info.pooltogether.com)
* Ratifying protocol upgrades
* Voting on requests for budgets

Any changes to these parameters have to undergo the PoolTogether governance process and are voted on by POOL token holders.

### **Governance Toolkit**

The major tools for PoolTogether governance are as follows:

* [**Governance Forum**](https://gov.pooltogether.com): The main space for discussion and ideation about changes to the protocol and governance proposals.
* [**Governance Dashboard**](https://vote.pooltogether.com/): Vote with POOL tokens held in your wallet or delegated to you.
* [**Snapshot**](https://snapshot.org/#/pooltogether.eth): A platform for off-chain governance.
* [**Discord**](https://pooltogether.com/discord): For informal governance discussion and feedback.

### Governance Contracts
