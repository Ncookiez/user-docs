# Governance

### PoolTogether Governance

POOL is the governance token of the PoolTogether community. Every POOL token represents a vote in governance.

The primary duty of POOL holder governance is to ensure the growth of the protocol. This includes:

* Protocol parameters like frequency of prizes
* Distributions from the [protocol treasury](https://info.pooltogether.com)
* Ratifying protocol upgrades
* Requests for budgets

Any changes to these parameters have to undergo the PoolTogether governance process and are voted on by POOL token holders.

### **Governance Toolkit**

The major tools for PoolTogether governance are as follows:

* [**Governance Forum**](https://gov.pooltogether.com): The main space for discussion and ideation about changes to the protocol and governance proposals.
* [**Governance Dashboard**](https://tally.xyz/gov/pooltogether): Vote with POOL tokens held in your wallet or delegated to you.
* [**Snapshot**](https://snapshot.org/#/pooltogether.eth): A platform for off-chain governance.
* [**Discord**](https://pooltogether.com/discord): For informal governance discussion and feedback.

### Governance Contracts

PoolTogether governance is based on an OpenZeppelin variant of Governor Bravo, with ScopeLiftâ€™s Flexible Voting extension. The Governor contract is deployed [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a907De47E00830a2b742db65e938a3ea1070A2E).

Previously, PoolTogether governance was using a fork of Compound's Governor Alpha smart contracts. The Upgrade to Governor Bravo was voted on in [PTIP-88](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/pooltogether-old/proposal/79). You can browse all past proposals [on Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/pooltogether-old/proposals).
